Retrospectives:

__Sprint 26 - 1/22/17 - 2/12/17__

My discipline has broken down. I have submitted a final project to 8th Light, and that took a hurculean effort as I have gone through probably the very worst time of my adult life. So in order to start things up again, I'm putting a bow on this scrum log. I have made amazing progress using this tool, and it provided me a structure to hold onto and direct my learning through a vast ocean of pottential subjects to learn while suffering the slings and arrows of a dying relationship with all of the grief, fear, misery and dispair that accompanies such events. I would highly recommend this tool to any self learner out there for any subject or project at all. It is immensely valuable.

that being said, I need to take about a month or so off from this structure. I can't maintain it right now, so it needs to fall away for a time. I need personal time to find who I am without my wife, and what I beleive about myself, and how I express that. I have put myself on hold trying to revive a failing relationship. Now it's time to take a different aproach and make myself as strong as I can be. My intention is to restart this after this "sabatical", but we'll have to see. I love software though. So I think I'll be back. But when I return it will be with a new scrum bucket. This one needs to be put to rest.

I could continue the scrum with completely non-software related stuff, but I think I need to develop this aspect of myself in private, then come back when its ready. also, as I mentioned, my discipline has broken down. I'll need to let it lie fallow for a time and then start the cycle again.

Actions:
 1. Take some unstructured time off.
 2. Discover what safety is again.
 3. Find out who I am, and what I want.
 4. Express that unconditionally.
 5. Return after I've found the path again.

__Sprint 25 - 1/15/17 - 1/21/17__

I have had very little to do this sprint. I went in with the intention of researching open-closed principle and decoupling abstractions, but hit an emotional wall. I signed the response paperwork to my wife's petition, and it has hit me pretty hard. I've been doing all I can to still go to my regular job and keep myself emotionally stable. I did keep my head above water, so to speak. So that was a win. But no real progress has been made in the realm of coding. Next week, I'll be spending a day at 8th Light's office. Dave was kind enough to offer me a safe place to code. I don't feel that way about my home any more.

To be honest, fear was a blocker in the past, fear that my wife would leave me, or become mad at some thing I did. But fear was still manageable. I could work around fear. I could go to cafes, or steal a few seconds here or there to learn and create. The positive feelings I generated from accomplishing those tasks would push the fear away enough to keep working. But now, it's not fear I'm fighting, it's despair. Despair is even more damaging to the creative process than fear. Fear, though inefficient, can still motivate you. Despair on the other hand takes what little energy you have away. Fighting despair is harder to do, but I feel that getting out of the environment that causes it will mitigate its effects. So for that reason I'm really grateful 8th Light is allowing me to ride an empty desk at their office. That will get me into a new environment and surrounded by warm people who will surely help kill the despair I feel.

Actions:
1. Too fucking stubborn to give up. I won't go gentle into that good night.
2. Start doing Free Code Camp exercises, they're so pathetically small that they might help gear you up for 8th Light day.
3. Get back into Learn Ruby the Hard Way for the same reason. In the words of Jim Butcher, "Polka will never die!"

__Sprint 24 - 1/8/17 - 1/14/17__

The sprint was all round preparing for this upcoming interview. And I certainly think that what I did was an improvement on the last one. I can't say "Yeah, I nailed it", but I did noticeably better this time around. I made sure to have questions for my interviewers, mad sure to be as prepared as I could be technically, made sure to be enthusiastic, but not so much as to appear to be a nut. So there were definately significant improvements. Whether that results in a job offer this time, I can't say, but I'm getting closer to understanding how to interview well. Interestingly enough, none of my front-end prep work was useful. That was just fine, because I wasn't exactly prepared for that. Also, the senior title was a typo, thankfully. That would have been embarrassing if they were expecting a senior.

I can't assume I'm going to get it, so next sprint I'm going to go back to tic-tac-toe. I am still very excited about the prospect of 8th Light's training regimen. If I am offered a position at this company that will be a question I will have, but I won't presume to get it. If I do, I'll deal with the consequences then. Otherwise, nothing has changed. I carry on.

Actions:
1. get back into that awesome routine you had in November-December
2. make something that is quality.
3. continue to care for yourself.

__Sprint 23 - 12/29/16 - 1/7/17__

This was an extra-long sprint because I forgot to end it at the right time. But it works out because I wanted to switch the start/end of the cycle to Saturday again. My wife asked for a divorce. It's amazing I got anything done at all. So besides having an unrelated full-time job, and the sudden worry of being able to take care of myself indepentently, I also have the emotional weight of the the end of a 7-year relationship on my hands. And then I'm trying to learn to code and make a career change. As I said, amazing I could get anything done at all.

But I'm not going to sit here and cry about how bad things are. Life is tough, and there are people out there who are facing worse. I've just got to try to move forward as best I can.

Actions:
1. Allow yourself to grieve, but don't give in to grief.
2. Be social, you need other humans right now.
3. Finish what you started.

__Sprint 22 - 12/22/16 - 12/28/16__

Fun for the holidays, this speint was a quasi break while I wait to hear the results. although it's fun to get back into the freedom of just playing with stuff :)

Actions:
1. Remember the joy of discovering this stuff
2. Don't forget to treat yourself well.
3. Be a bit more of an asshole, you're so nice it's hurting you and the people around you.

__Sprint 21 - 12/15/16 - 12/21/16__

Man, am I glad I do the most important stuff first! It means I get what needs to get done right away, I maximize my time for that and inadvertantly steer clear of scope creep issues. It meant that I had the requirements met early this sprint, and could spend time working on getting rid of technical debt, making things clean and beautiful (well, less ugly), and all with a worry-free mind that could really bring itself to bear on the problem. I had a lot of stress because of the fact that this was the delivery version. This is what 8th Light will be evaulating me on. Even with the stress lowered by getting the important stuff done first, I was nervous enough to be sick. I couldn't imagine the paralyzing fear approching the goal differently would have caused. It would not have been pretty. Any case, I've been pushing myself to the limit. It's time to back off and goof around. The next push will come another sprint.

Actions:
1. Take it easy and have some undirected fun. You've earned it.
2. Keep this process, it's working well for you.
3. Prepare for the next push, when it comes.

__Sprint 20 - 12/8/16 - 12/14/16__

This sprint I found some value codifying my commitments to my goal, ethics, and craftsmanship. It is hard to maintain a commitment to quality day after day, but no one can do it for you. You are the only perosn who can make craftsmanship happen in your work. It takes moral fortitude and strength of will to continually bring your whole self to bear on a project. So I decided to make a statement to that effect. I was willing to push things to next sprint for the sake of quality. My product is stronger because of it.

Actions:
1. Don't forget about the joy of making something well.
2. Maintain your commitment.
3. Develop the muscle to continually apply your best self to the task.

__Sprint 19 - 12/1/16 - 12/7/16__

I took the concept of courage to the next level this sprint. Instead of fighting a defensive battle against my exhaustion and then having the courage to stand up to it and take breaks as needed, I took the initiative. I gave up on trying to get both a complete unbeatable algorithm and good abstractions, and focused on clean and simple code. Instead of fighting fear, I gave up on it completely and focused on having joy, and paying close attention to my craft. It really made a difference in the statisfaction I had with my work. So I plan to do this in the future.

Actions:
1. dont just have courage to stand up to fear. toss it asside altogether.
2. Focus instead on having joy in observing and experiencing the art and craft of developing software.
3. take whatever time you need. Don't write fast. Write good. Speed comes later. Observe good code. Use those meditation skills. Use those theatre rehearsal skills. Have joy and commit to the craft of the present moment.

__Sprint 18 - 11/24/16 - 11/30/16__

The choice to have courage to not do work when I was exhausted was tested several times across the sprint. I really worried I couldn't get it all done. (In fact, I didn't.) The Travis CI deployment got pushed back, although, that wasn't as important as some of the other stories. I Hope to be able to tackle it this time. It still is not as important as good tests, a working and clean unbeatable algorithm, or ensuring the code is clean and maintainable. I think I may be getting the hang of this. Anyway, that courage paid off in not creating more work for myself. I was astounded how many times after banging my head against a wall for an hour or two with a particular problem, by going for a walk and coming back fresh I could have the solution in 15 minutes. I'll need to remember that one. The bottle neck is not how fast you type, or how many hours you have to work, it's the quality of your mind during those hours. Which for me means frequent breaks. The better I treat myself, the more peace I could give myself, the easier it was to bring my mind to bear on the problem. Ok, so that works. I'll have to keep doing that.

Actions:
1. Continue with paying yourself well in respect.
2. Take frequent breaks. A few high quality minutes are worth hours of lesser quality, if you can even solve the problem at all.
3. Not writing bad code pays 3 times what writing code to "appear to be working" does. When you write bad code. you waste your time writing it, you waste your time reading it later, and you ultimately waste your time refactoring it. Not writing bad code is a serious value proposition. Don't write bad code. If you are so exhausted you can't maintain discipline, you need a break.

__Sprint 17 - 11/17/16 - 11/23/16__

That was fun... but also exhausting. It put my new-found habits to the test. There were plenty of times where I was mentally exhausted and gave up a little on my values. I didn't TDD everything. Or I would write "exploratory code" (which is now pretty permanent). Or I would commit only after 3 or 4 changes in 3 or 4 files. When you're too tired to go on, one of the fist things to go are your values and commitment to quality. I was too eager to get something shippable in a week. And now I have to pay a bit of a price for it. That last late night was not glorious. It kind of undid the good stuff I was doing at the start of the sprint all because I was afraid I couldn't make the goal. But what's more important? Making the goal, or doing something right and taking the time to learn? I would have been better for me to take my time and do it right. I've only got 15 to 20 hours a week to code, probably 10 hours of flow time max. Is that enough time to realistically create a quality game like this? I was afraid of failing, I was afraid of not getting the apprenticeship, so I rushed, and marred my work. To be fair, it's really not terrible work, but there are things that probably wouldn't have happened had I slowed down and taken the time to think, not to mention respect my own process and take a break when I started to flag in adhering to TDD or clean code, and most importantly had the courage to do a good job and not give in to fear of failure or not being good enough in some way. I have a real problem with personal self worth, and I think that's the root cause of the flaws in my performance. So onward!

Actions:
1. Give yourself the respect a human being of good character earns. Pay yourself in respect. Pay generously. Don't let anyone steal or destroy your pay.
2. If you notice your commitment to clean code, TDD, or careful commits flagging, it's time for a break. Go treat yourself well. Allow your mind to wander, wonder and create. It's more valuable to write no code as opposed to bad code, even if it means you don't make the progress you hoped for. Man, is not writing code valuable. Less to debug!!!
3. "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

Don't let your fear drive you to make bad code. have the courage to do less than expected, but have it be total quality. Identify that you are rushing because of fear. You are paying a terrible price because of fear. And it will have consequences. (in live production it could mean causing people to be opressed or killed by your hasty decisions!) Face the angry manager of you mind and quote the above. Every evil act is done because of fear convincing you to part with your values.

Next sprint should therefore focus on cleaning up the mess I made. Debugging, Refactoring, eliminating anything stated twice, documenting, adding personal touches, taking the time to think and research, and eliminating anything stated twice.

...And another thing, I was so focused on writing clean functions and micro-statements that I failed to notice that I was repeating myself across modules and classes! I'll need to correct that by looking up at the big picture this next sprint.

__Sprint 16 - 11/10/16 - 11/16/16__

That turned out well! Now I need to completely shift my footing. Put my money where my mouth is and really deliver some quality. I have been charged next with creating an unbeatable tic tac toe game. I'm afraid that I won't be able to do this, but really. I can do this. I just have to remember all the good habits I've been forming, use those to approach the problem, and ride them to delivery. The key I'll need to focus on is quality. But this is exactly the kind of opportunity I have been preparing for. 

Changing the sprint timing was a really great idea. The primary blocker will be the time my regular job takes up.

Actions:
 1. Don't Panic.
 2. remember to break the problem into smaller problems.
 3. remember to test drive and focus.
 4. use every resource at your disposal.
 5. commit everything to this opportunity.

__Sprint 15 - 11/6/16 - 11/9/16__

this is a short sprint. This is because it just makes sense for now to switch the day of my reviews/retros to correspond with the companies who are contacting me. (This is a fantastic problem to have!!!) So for a while, now, we're going to switch our cadence and take a half-sprint to accomplish finding a rythm that works with reality. In any case, wow! That was a productive 3 days! And it all went to a single purpose, which, considering that this was my very first technical interview ever, it went really really well. And in addition, I got another phone screen coming up with another company! Things are happening so fast it's making me a little queezy with nerves. I need to invest in calming down. I'm also very thankful that previous major blockers are not interfering with my success, and even turning into encouraging elements. that bodes well for my ability to accelerate.

things to work on for future interviews: watch out for things that are on the test that are not explicitly stated are on the test! I suppose Noobs don't realize that thse things are "Obviously" going to be on the test, but:
Being able to talk confidently about the basics of:
 - OOP
 - Data Structures
 - Algorythms
 - Big O
 - Functional (Maybe)

There are other areas, but those are big ones, and some other important ones I got pretty solid.

Actions:
 1. don't panic.
 2. Switch sprint review/retro day to wednesday, because that's the the day when s**t goes down.
 3. rearrange priorities of learning to meet business requests (Isn't it great to get feedback? Now you can really play ball!)
 4. Don't Panic.
 5:. Be f***king awesome.

__Sprint 14 - 10/29/16 - 11/5/16__

I did push myself too hard last sprint. I got very sick. To make matters worse, I had some really terrible fights with someone close to me. It has really shaken me and has become the primary blocker to my success. I greive for that, but I don't have the time to spend. I also had a very successful screening interview and now I have a technical screen to worry about. I can't afford any distractions to making sure I am as awesome as possible. So I have to put all that aside and really focus in peace. After the screen I can make personal matters a priority, which they will likely get even worse. Again, can't worry about that now. I got to make this work.

Actions:
 1. be nice to yourself - have peace and quiet and safety.
 2. Focus on f****ng nailing the next screen.


__Sprint 13 - 10/23/16 - 10/29/16__

This sprint was spent primarily cleaning up from the last conference. I made sure to follow up on all the contacts I made. I also did some interesting open-source work with Justin Dorfman and with Hack for LA. Pushing myself as hard as I have last sprint has causes me to get sick this week. I really should remember not to push that hard. Now i will spend this sprint with a major hit to velocity, and next sprint will feel it too. I'm pushing back my estimate on when I will be done Learn Ruby the Hard way to December 24. I might be able to make up some time, but even if I do, It'll probably be another sprint before things are complete.

Actions:
 1. Get well. Take it easy. Take care of yourself.
 2. Be casreful not to push yourself that hard.

__Sprint 12 - 10/16/16 - 10/22/16__

This sprint has been exhausting but productive. I am coming hard upon the limits that my feeble human mind can take, so I should remember what this feels like. Pushing past this point is not something that will be sustinably productive. I made some great progress. I also was able to maintain my self-confidence and create a workable level of ego. It's okay to be scared, but I will need to push past that and make sure to do more coding. I need to drive in pairs. I need to assert myself to contribute. so I must continue to maintain, build and defend a healthy sense of self-worth. It is a neccessary investment in my future. I know this ego is not myself, but I need an ego to engage the universe.

Actions:
 1. Continue to not tiptoe around. Do things boldly and with self-possesiveness.
 2. Keep buiding an emotional savings account that will allow me to be bold and helpful.
 3. Drive in pair programming. Talk. But make sure to code as much as you talk (which is a lot).

__Sprint 11 - 10/9/16 - 10/15/16__

The sprint was more productive than expected, which is again encouraging. I have found that it's best to consistently give myself the slightly easier goal of 30 points and getting to around 40 by the end of the sprint rather than setting the goal at 40 and struggling to meet it. For whatever reason, 30 points is a significant number, but allows some slack to add on unpredictable extras without stress, and also gives me a sense of accomplishment when I consistently blow it out of the water.

I have discovered also that my emotional state doesn't have too great an impact on my velocity. I can work even if I'm completely miserable. I have to work harder, but it doesn't seem to impact the velocity that much. 10 to 25% at most. I will say instead that my emotional state, sense of confidence and self-worth are desirable in and of themselves. I don't plan to live without them. They are still not just nice-to-haves. I can carry on through dark times, but those dark times can't last forever. I will eventually cave in. And that's the real danger of not maintaining my spirits, not the current velocity.

Actions:
 1. Don't tiptoe around. Do what I will do. Acknowledge shortcomings, work to improve, but make no applolgies.
 2. Maintain and defend a cheerful spirit. Don't let circumstances rob you of it.

__Sprint 10 - 10/2/16 - 10/8/16__

There were major disruption to what is normal during this sprint: There was a 5 day conference, so most of the time was geared toward socializing and making friends (some call this networking, but I call it making friends). The other major incident was that my computer was damaged by someone I trust. This has made me take some serious time off of the project to stop that from happening again.

actions:
 1. If there is any more violence, to defend my safety and the velocity of the project, I have to leave.
 2. Make sure to be vulnerable and let my trusted parter know how deeply I am sorry for their pain, and my part in producing it. The hope here is that by doing this, I can start to repair the damage.
 3. It is my impression that both of these points have been communicated. I need to take care of my personal relationships so that they don't become blockers to my progress, and also just because it's the right thing to do.

__Sprint 9 - 9/25/16 - 10/1/16__

It was a very productive sprint. There was a major concern that a resurgeance in empotional and domestic upheaval would wreck the velocity and cause Learn Python the Hard Way to come in too late for the conference, but everything got done. Moreover, the extra time was useful for cleaning up some pesky chores and technical debt. Still, I did take a hit because of that. It has been two sprints of peace before this one, and now I can see it does have an impact. I can expect to loose at least 3 points when they happen.

Actions: It can be like walking on egg shells, but you have to manage your mood and the moods of those around you. Them getting you down will add months at least to the end-goal of becoming a competent and employed developer. Trouble is, I have no precise way to go about accomplishing this. I'll just have to try to be useful and competent and hoe that mitigates things.

__Sprint 8 - 9/18/16 - 9/24/16__

This sprint saw a ramping in productivity. I got much more done than anticipated. This is primarily due to a lack of blockers and a focus on uninterrupted productive time during my most productive days: Monday through Wednesday. I have one more week to complete Learn Python the Hard Way before the conference. Then I'll be prepared, and hopefully will be able to make the call about whether to continue with Python there, or pivot to Ruby in preparation for the conference after that.

Actions: Keep going.

__Sprint 7 - 9/11/16 - 9/17/16__

This sprint went well. The goal this week was pretty straight-forward. No task switching. Just work on the workbook, and code every day. It went extrememly well, as this is one of the first sprints in a long time where everything that was supposed to get done got done. Not only that, but all was accomplished with a visit from my parents and a company barbique for my wife's company. So I did not have full hours to work. Most of the tasks were completed by Wednesday, which is what I will aim for in the future as clearly that pattern is a successful one. My opportunity for productivity is front-loaded on the week. 80% of what I do is accomplished before Thursday. Also, 30 - 35 points is becoming a very stable velocity, which I can track and make estimates based on.

One of the major benefits to working this way is that I know how valuable my time is, and what I can realistically accomplish when I use that time for developing myself. I know myself in a way I never thought I could thanks to scrum. Before time was just infinite, I had "all the time in the world". and if I did not, I panicked and hid from whatever thing dared to demand completion within a limit. I also used to think very big ideas, and unrealistically would try to cram them into an impossibly narrow time window for completion. Just because I could envision the end product all-at-once did not mean that I could accomplish it all-at-once too. This was a massive stressor in learning to be a developer. Now, however, I can realistically plot my course and not stess because I know much better how long things take, and where I am on that journey. I also know that just because It can't be done in the time it takes to snap my fingers, no matter how hard I might try to make that happen, it doesn't mean it can't be done. I have realistic confidence, awareness and time management skills from using scrum. and they're still developing. So this is very exciting for me.

Actions: Keep going.

__Sprint 6 - 9/4/16 - 9/10/16__

The sprint took into account the book, and properly guaged, it turns out to be pretty much right on. So I can say that my average velocity is somewhere around 30. If I try to do less, I'll do more. If I try to do more, I'll do less. This gives me a good estimate for longer term planning. There are 16 exercises left in Learn Python the Hard way. However, they show an alarming tendency to increase in time-dificulty as I proceed. we'll have to see, but I might be able to fnish the book before the conference If I make it a priority.

Emotional problems are becoming less constant, and more manageable when they do happen. Now that I have to courage to acknowlege they exist, I'm actually starting to understand how to cope. How to have compassion on myself, yet still focus on getting things done. Basically, how to manage myself sustainably, which is a remarkable thing.

This is the first week with no new notes, just keep doing it, and keep doing the actions that corrected your behavior enough to bring you here.


__Sprint 5 - 8/28/16 - 9/3/16__

The sprint was more Manageable. There are two things that happened that I should have been aware of:
 1. I wanted to get more things in than 25 points would allow, so I arteficially deflated the value of several tasks to fit. It was still a lot of work, so by the end of the sprint I had to increase their value, along with the value of a particularly large blog post. Idea structures held holographically in the mind can be glanced in a second, but writing those out in one dimension, or having another read the concepts that make up that structure *takes time* You can't judge how big an idea is based on whenter or not you can hold the whole thought in your head or not. You can hold thoughts of both simplicity and vast complexity there and they feel the same. Find another way to evaluate the magnitude of a task like that.
 2. I do a lot of things that are related to the sprint tangentially, but are not recorded in the sprint. These things take up time, and should be added to the sprint, even though they are disruptive. It will give me a clearer picture of my velocity when I add in these stories-of-opportunity, and help me make better choices about what I have to drop when I accept them.

Actions:
1. Commitment to 30
2. Be careful in evaluating doccumentation and explaination tasks. You can bring up the info in a second, but relaying that info takes time.
3. Add in stories-of-opportunity even though the practice is a little heinous to sprints. Be honest with yourself about this so that you can evaluate their effects and make more well-informed choices.

__Sprint 4 - 8/15/16 - 8/27/16__

This sprint dropped another story. So We're dropping the velocity again to an ammount I can handle. This is hard to do. I feel like I'm failing. But truthfully, I'm just facing known fact and planning with that limitation in mind. The reason for the dropped story was very similar to last sprint. Thursday evening and Friday are not reliably productive days. I do need to take care of my wife during that time, and the loss of that corner of the time box meant I could not fit the last day's work into it effectively.

Actions:
1. Commitment to 25
2. For now, understand Wednesday is your last day for full scale productivity. Thursday/Friday can only contribute minimally.
3. Explain scrum piece by piece to my wife so that she can help me get a job more quickly rather than cause a slow-down.

__Sprint 3 - 8/14/16 - 8/20/16__

This sprint went well, but even with the decrease in velocity, I am still coming up short. And frankly, shorter than when my velocity was at 50+. This is the first sprint where I missed part of the delivery commitment. This is becoming a trend. I'll have to watch this.

In the mean time, the first solution is to decrease the velocity again. If another decrease in velocity is needed next week, I will look into what obstacles are keeping me from moving forward and see about removing those.

taking care of myself was a good move. It's better to do that than to try to hide problems. I'll track more carefully what consistently blocks me from higher velocity next sprint.

Actions:
1. commitment to 35
2. watch for patterns of things that block my progress.

__Sprint 2 - 8/7/16 - 8/13/16__

This sprint was intense, but I still did it. Needless to say, It was close to the edge, and it dodn't feel as great as when I completed sprint 1 even though I got more than twice done. I'm over-exerting myself.

Any negative feeling have an immediate affect on my concentration and velocity. I need to be happy to be productive. I need to be feeling good to think clearly. Certain aspects of my environment cannot be changed, and attention is going to be drawn from the project to combat them. This means I can't expect there to be no rainy days. Factor them in. And as much as possible proactively mitigate them.

Mid-day chores like going to a doctor's appointment mean any time after that even is essentially wasted for the sprint. remember that chores take time. Account for that, or do them early and often beofre the y become big enough to derail your workflow.

Doing smaller stories when time is low is fine, but it's also ok to break a story into smaller tasks so you can start on the mission critical stuff first.

Actions:
1. Pair the commitment down to 40
2. Maintain my mood by treating myself well
3. Do chores early and often.
4. Break stories into requirements when time is low

__Sprint 1 - 7/31/16 - 8/6/16__

I seem to think that "Do a problem from Learn Python the Hard Way" or "Apply for a job" is an activity that takes 0 time. That just ain't so. I'm going to have to get used to the idea that nothing takes 0 time.

All things considered, this went pretty well. I certainly hope I've created a pace I can keep up. That's going to be very important for the future.

I also am going to have to remember to try to take very small bites for working days, especially days where my work schedule cuts my time into 2 tiny 1-2 hour blocks on either end. I'll need to remember to pace myself, and also be careful that I do not waste the precious little time I have.

Actions:
1. Take into account that all things take time.
2. Remember your time is precious. don't waste it frivolously. Every minute counts.
3. Tread lightly but surely and you can keep the pace forever.
